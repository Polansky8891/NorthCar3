    <h1 class="main-title"> TIME TRIALS SAFETY RULES </h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle"><em>We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America </h2></em>
    <p>Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or death to participants,spectators<br> or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using  superior safety gear paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory<br> issues to the event officials.Drivers are responsible for ensuringthat the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation<br>  under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a Technical  Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and<br> available to present to an SCCA Official.</p>
    <p>Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the best protection that current technology<br>can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.</p>
    <p>National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety  required by these Rules.In these cases,<br> there are two additional Safety Levels.</p>

            <br><strong><li>Convertibles</li></strong>
                <p>It is highly recommended that all convertible vehicles be equipped with an aftermarket roll bar<br> that meets or exceeds the standards set in the Time Trials Safety Standard Level 2 (see<br> below). However, minimum safety standards requires the vehicle meets at least one of the<br> following criteria and is not subject to any of the listed exceptions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <br><strong><li>Convertible vehicles up to and including the 2005 model year</strong> must have rollover protection<br> meeting one of the following criteria:</li>
                    <ol type="A">
                        <br><li>The vehicle is equipped with documented factory installed roll over protection. (Examples of<br> manufacturer-documented roll over protection include hydroformed and reinforced a-pillars or<br> windshield frame and factory installed roll bars and/or “pop-up” bars that are designated as roll<br> over protection.)</li>
                        <br><li>The vehicle is equipped with a commercially produced roll bar or roll cage which is described<br> by the manufacturer to provide track-appropriate rollover protection. (E.g., “style” bars are not<br> acceptable.)</li>
                        <br><li>The vehicle is equipped with a roll bar that meets the Safety Level 2 standards for material and<br> construction.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br><li><strong>Convertible vehicles of the 2006 model year or later</strong> must have a roll bar that meets the Safety<br> Level 2 standards for material and construction unless one of the following criteria is met.</li>
                    <ol type="A">
                        <br><li>The vehicle is equipped with documented factory-installed roll over protection or a<br> commercially produced roll bar or roll cage which is described by the manufacturer to provide<br> track-appropriate rollover protection.</li>
                        <br><li>The vehicle is six (6) cylinders, with the OE drivetrain and may only be naturally aspirated.</li>
                        <br><li>The vehicle is four (4) cylinders or less, with the OE drivetrain, including any forced-induction<br> equipment.</li>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This means that for 2006+ vehicles, if the engine is not the original equipment model as<br> delivered in that vehicle,  aftermarket forced induction has been installed, or the vehicle has more<br> than six (6) cylinders or six (6) cylinders and forced induction of any type, the vehicle must have<br> aftermarket rollover protection or documented factory rollover protection.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <br><strong><li>T-tops and targa top cars:</li></strong>
                    <p>T-top and targa top cars are not considered convertibles, and do not fall under the convertible<br> requirements.</p>

    <br><strong><li>SAFETY LEVEL 2</li></strong>
        <ol>
            <br><strong><li>Overview</li></strong>
            <p>Safety Level 2 generally means a 4-point roll bar, 5-point racing harness, arm restraints or window<br> net, and fire-retardant helmets and clothing.</p>
            <p>For Time Trials Nationals Events, vehicles running on DOT-approved tires with less than 200 <br> treadwear or beyond Max Category Rules must meet Safety Level 2 Standards. Vehicles with <br> modified or aftermarket fuel tanks and lines which run through the cockpit will need to meet <br> Safety Level 2 Standards for driver clothing.</p>
            <p>All vehicles required to meet Safety Level 2 Standards must meet the Safety Level 1 Standards,<br> plus the additions below.</p>
            <br><strong><li>Vehicle Equipment</li></strong>
                <ol>
                    <br><strong><li>Roll Bars</li></strong>
                    <br><p>These specifications apply to all vehicles (other than those issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19).<br> Cars issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19 may continue to compete with their previously <br> approved rollover structure or comply with the following specifications.</p>
                    <p>A roll bar is defined as a main hoop and diagonal placed behind the driver and supplemented by <br>two braces. The roll bar must be designed to withstand compression forces resulting from the <br> weight of the car coming down on the roll structure, and to take fore-and-aft loads resulting from <br> the car skidding along the ground on the roll structure. The basic purpose of the roll bar is to <br> protect the driver in case the vehicle rolls over. Roll bars must meet the following criteria:</p>
                    <ol type="A">
                        <br><li>One continuous length of tubing must be used for the hoop member with smooth continuous <br> bends and no evidence of crimping or wall failure.</li>
                        <br><li>The top of the roll bar must be above the top of the driver’s helmet when the driver is in normal <br> driving position.</li>
                        <br><li>The two (2) vertical members forming the sides of the hoop must be more than 15 inches apart <br> (inside dimension), and it is desirable that it extend the full width of the cockpit.</li>
                        <br><li>An inspection hole of at least 3/16 inch diameter to facilitate verification of wall thickness may <br> be required. It must be drilled in a non-critical area of a roll bar member at least three inches from <br> any weld or bend.</li>
                        <br><li>All bolts and nuts shall be SAE Grade 5 or better, 5/16-inch minimum diameter.</li>
                        <br><li>Braces and portions of the main hoop subject to contact by the driver’s or passenger’s helmet,<br> as seated normally and restrained by seatbelt and harness, must be padded with a non-resilient <br> material such as Ethafoam® or Ensolite® or other similar material with a minimum thickness of 1/2 <br> inch. Padding meeting SFI spec 45.1 or FIA 8857-2001 is strongly recommended.</li>
                        <br><li>The size of tubing to be used for the main hoop, braces and diagonals shall be determined on <br> the basis of the weight of the car. The following minimum sizes are required and are based upon <br> the weight of the car without the driver. Dimensions are nominal; 0.010-inch variation in wall <br> thickness is allowed.</li>

                        <br><li>The roll bar hoop and all braces must be of seamless or DOM mild steel tubing (SAE 1010, 1020,<br> 1025) or equivalent, or alloy steel tubing (SAE 4130). For cars logbooked before 1/1/16, existing<br> ERW tubing is acceptable.</li>
                        <br><li>All welding should be of the highest possible quality with full penetration. Craters should be filled<br> to the cross section of the weld and undercut be no more than 0.01 inch deep.</li>
                        <br><li>All roll bars must be braced in a manner to prevent movement in a fore-and-aft direction with<br> the braces attached within the top third of the roll hoop. At a minimum, two (2) braces must be<br> used, parallel to the sides of the car, and placed at the outer extremities of the roll bar hoop. Such<br> braces should extend to the rear whenever possible. Diagonal lateral bracing must be installed to<br> prevent lateral distortion of the hoop. In most cases, a lateral brace from the bottom corner of the<br> hoop on the side to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is sufficient. Although installing the<br> diagonal lateral brace in the main hoop is the strongest alternative (and hence most preferable),<br> there may be instances where such an installation is not practical. In such situations, the<br> installation of the diagonal brace running from the bottom of the fore/aft brace on one side to the<br> top corner of the hoop on the other side is acceptable. In convertible vehicles with a production<br> line beginning 1990 or later, such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design, also known as a “double<br> diagonal” used between the rear supports is acceptable.</li>
                        <br><li>Removable roll bars and braces must be very carefully designed and constructed to be at least<br> as strong as a permanent installation. If one (1) tube fits inside another tube to facilitate removal,<br> the removable portion must fit tightly and must bottom on the permanent mounting, and at least<br> two (2) bolts must be used to secure each telescope section. The telescope section must be at<br> least eight inches in length. One (1) bolt is required if one (1) end is welded to the main hoop.</li>
                        <br><li>Roll bars and braces must be attached to the frame of the car wherever possible. Mounting<br> plates may be used for this purpose where desired.</li>
                        <br><li>In the case of cars with unitized or frameless construction, mounting plates may be used to<br> secure the roll bar structure to the car floor. The important consideration is that the load be<br> distributed over as large an area as possible.

            <br><strong><li>Overview</li></strong>
            <p>It is intended that Safety Level 3 be similar to that of SCCA Road Racing. Vehicles of motorsports-<br>specific construction are required to meet these specifications. For National Time Trial Events,<br> vehicles prepared beyond Max Category Rules and competing on tires without DOT-Approval<br> must meet Safety Level 3 Standards.</p>
            <p>All Safety Level 3 vehicles must meet the requirements of Safety Levels 1 and 2, plus the inclusion<br> of a roll cage compliant with specifications listed here. A roll cage consists of the main hoop, front<br> hoop, side protection, and braces as specified in these Rules.</p>
            <p>These specifications apply to all vehicles other than those issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19.<br> Cars issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19 may continue to compete with their previously<br> approved rollover structure or comply with the following specifications.</p>
            <p>Please see <a href="https://www.scca.com/pages/cars-and-rules">SCCA General Competition Rules</a> section 9.4 for diagrams and illustrations.</p>

                <ol>
                    <br><strong><li>Main Hoop</li></strong>
                    <p>The main hoop (behind the driver) must be the full width of the cockpit for all cars. It must be one<br> continuous length of tubing with smooth bends and no evidence of crimping or wall failure. The<br> main hoop must maintain a single plane.</p>
                        <ol type="A">
                            <br><li>On all closed cars, the main hoop must be as close as possible to the roof and “B” pillars.</li>
                            <br><li>On open cars retaining the windshield frame, the main hoop must be full height for the entire<br> width of the hoop. The top of the main hoop must be at least 2 inches above the driver’s helmet.</li>
                            <br><li>Open cars without the windshield frame may use an asymmetric main hoop. The main hoop<br> must be full width to the passenger side of the car. On the passenger side of the car, the hoop<br> must be at least as high as the top of the rear corner of the door. The main hoop must be high<br> enough that a straight line drawn from the top of the main hoop to the top of the front hoop would<br> pass over the driver’s helmet and steering wheel when the driver is seated in the normal driving<br> position. Additionally, the top of the main hoop must be at least 2 inches above the driver’s helmet.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <br><strong><li>Main Hoop Bracing</li></strong>
                        <ol type="A">
                            <br><li>Main hoops shall incorporate a diagonal brace. The brace shall either be in the plane of the main<br> hoop or extend from the top of one rear brace to the bottom of the opposite rear brace.<br> Automobiles with mid-mounted engines can have the lower mounting point attach to the frame of<br> the automobile within 6 inches of the main hoop. In the case of braces in the plane of the main<br> hoop, the brace must span at least 50% of the width of the main hoop, and at least 75% of the<br> height of the main hoop. In convertible vehicles with a production line beginning 1990 or later,<br> such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design, also known as a “double diagonal” used between the rear<br> supports is acceptable.</li>
                            <br><li>Cars must incorporate a main hoop horizontal brace at the approximate level of the driver’s<br> shoulders but not lower than the shoulder belt mounting point as described. If a double-diagonal<br> “X” brace is used in the plane of the main hoop, a half-width horizontal brace may be used behind<br> the driver’s seat to mount the seat back and shoulder harness.</li>
                            <br><li>Cars must have two (2) braces extending to the rear from the main hoop and attaching to the<br> frame or chassis. Braces must be attached as near as possible to the top of the main hoop (not<br> more than 6 inches below the top), and at an included angle of at least 30 degrees.</li>
                            <br><li>Open cars must have two (2) braces extending forward from the main hoop and attaching to<br> the front hoop, not more than 6 inches below the top of the front and main hoop. It is<br> recommended that the front and rear braces attach to the main hoop as close as possible to each<br> other.</li>
                            <br><li>On cars where the rear window/bulkhead prohibits the installation of rear braces (e.g., Honda<br> del Sol), the main hoop shall be attached to the body by plates welded to the cage and bolted to<br> the stock shoulder harness mounting points. This installation design must incorporate a<br> diagonal bar connecting the top of the main hoop to the lower front passenger side mounting<br> point (Petty bar). Alternatively, the rear window may be removed and a clear, LEXAN™<br> replacement installed. The rear cage braces may pass through this replacement window and<br> through the engine cover or bodywork to allow connection to the frame or unibody.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <br><strong><li>Front Hoop</li></strong>

                            <br><li>Roll cages may be of two designs, low front hoop or high front hoop. All closed-top cars and<br> cars that retain the windshield frame must have a high front hoop design. Open cars may<br> incorporate a high or low front hoop design. High front hoops are also referred to as side hoops.</li>
                                <ol>
                                    <br><li>Closed cars: The front hoop (side hoop) must follow the line of the A-pillars to the top of the<br> windshield and be connected by horizontal bars to the top of the main hoop on each side (as close<br> to the roof as possible). Instead of a single front hoop, two side hoops (down tubes) may be used.<br> Alternatively, a top “halo” hoop following the roof line from the main hoop to the windshield with<br> forward down tubes following the A-pillars to the floor may be used. Regardless of which one of<br> the two approved tubing configurations, there shall be a tube connecting the two A-pillar tubes at<br> the top of the windshield.</li>
                                    <br><li>Open cars: The height of the front hoop must be consistent across the full width of the cockpit.</li>
                                </ol>
                            <br><strong><li>Front Hoop Bracing</strong><br>All open cars with a high front hoop and all tube frame closed cars must incorporate a horizontal<br> front hoop brace at the approximate level of the dashboard. It is recommended production-<br>chassis cars also have the front hoop brace.</li>
                                <ol>
                                    <br><li>One tube may extend, from each front down tube, forward to the firewall or for Unlimited or<br> SCCA GCR-class cars through the firewall. In this case it is recommended this tube, one on each<br> side, connect to the chassis at a point not more than 12 inches forward of the front axle centerline.</li>
